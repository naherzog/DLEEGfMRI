EEG-to-fMRI Deep Learning Model for Ventral Striatum Reward Prediction

Code & Data Repository for “From surface to depth: using deep learning to predict striatal fMRI reward signaling from EEG” (Herzog et al., in prep)

The project adapts BEIRA, a convolutional autoencoder model (Kovalev et al., 2022), to reconstruct ventral striatum (VS) BOLD activity from simultaneous EEG during a well-validated two-choice gambling reward task. 
Unlike subject-specific models, this work trains a single group-level model and evaluates its cross-participant generalization.
